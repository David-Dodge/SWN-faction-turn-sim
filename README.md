# SWN-faction-turn-sim
This repo contains a simulator for running scenarios that may occur during a StarsWithoutNumber (revised edition) Faction Turn game. It was created specifically for use within the Far Verona universe created by RollPlay, but can be easily adapted for any StarsWithoutNumbers universe.
